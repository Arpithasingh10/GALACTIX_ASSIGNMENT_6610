## Problem Statement

Educational institutions collect large volumes of student feedback
related to courses, teaching quality, and workload. Manually reviewing
this feedback is time-consuming and inefficient.

The goal of this system is to automatically analyze student feedback
using AI-driven sentiment analysis and assign a priority score to
help administrators quickly identify areas requiring attention.

This system is designed for academic coordinators and faculty
members who need fast insights into student satisfaction.
